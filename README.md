    Worked at gathering the API data from thedogapi.com.
        ==> Could not figure out has to get the data properly using the jQuery document ready syntax.
        ==> Searched the internet for a work around & found code using hmlhttp.

    Wanted to code a carousel with all the bells & whistles but could not get the site to work.

    Found a animation that drops text from the top of screen as though they were connected.

    I believe I spent too much time on getting API data to work as I wanted & spent too much time working on the carousel, which I could not get to work. Spending a majority of the time searching the internet for answers.

    I would like to visit this project again to "pretty it up" a bit & have an image carousel.
